## Groundz Worldwide

Displays all the grounds visited by myself throughout the world, with images laoded from Flickkr utilising the FlickrAPI.

## Improvements

In its current state, some of the image sizes are particularly large and hence take a while to load. This results in some image flickering. I am currently investigating ways to prevent this, including image preloading or caching.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
